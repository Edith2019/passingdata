## About

Short description of data flow to render data from input fields within the current component. In addition, detailed the data flow between parent to child and child to parent.

This project is meant to evolve and every two weeks, some more information about data flow will be added together with data structure information.

Please note that the styling is made in order to visualise the code and not to to make it pretty.
